## Abstract

The goal of the project is, to identify a person on a real life image, and then make a portrait of him / her in painting style.
There will be 2 steps:
 * Find the person
 * "Zoom in" on him / her
 * Make a portrait in painting style

For example: The input is an image of a building, where the entire building is shown, and a person stands in front of the frontdoor. The output will be a painting, on which is the person and only (part of) the door in background.
