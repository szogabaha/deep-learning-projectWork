## Abstract

The goal of the project is to identify a person on a real life image, and then make a portrait of him / her in painting style.
There will be 3 steps:
 * Find the person
 * "Zoom in" on him / her
 * Make a portrait in a specific painting style

For example: The input is an image of a building, where the entire building is shown, and a person stands in front of the frontdoor. The output is going to be a painting on which  the person is shown and the background it cropped to serve as a proper portrait background.
